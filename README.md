## scalient-rails - An Open Source Library Incubator for Useful Rails Middleware from Scalient LLC

Over the greater part of a decade, we at Scalient LLC have been extracting common software architectural patterns,
especially for Ruby on Rails, into reusable, intuitive, and robust software libraries. The result is scalient-rails, a
grab bag of functionality for supporting the essentials of web applications. Our aim is to eventually spin off (and open
source) the most used components into separate middleware libraries in the future to unlock growth potential and gain
exposure in the marketplace for ideas.
